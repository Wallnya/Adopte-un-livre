<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Adopte un livre aims to plagiarize the trend of dating sites. However, its goal is to find the perfect book for its reader. A crazy little idea that was born in my mind and that wants to be creative and innovative!

This application proposes in particular:
* The discovery of new books
* The swiping left and right that we love so much
* The possibility to add new books
* A reminder of the different buttons of the application

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)

And many others
